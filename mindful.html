        <h2>Simple Daily Practices</h2>
        <p>You don't need a meditation cushion or a quiet room to be mindful. These three practices can be easily integrated into your daily routine.</p>
        
        <div class="practice-cards-list">
            <div class="practice-card">
                <h3>1. Mindful Breathing</h3>
                <p>This is the foundation of mindfulness. You can do it anywhere, anytime. Simply take a moment to pause and notice your breath. Feel the air as it enters your nostrils, fills your lungs, and slowly leaves your body. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to the sensation of breathing.</p>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h3>2. Mindful Walking</h3>
                <p>Turn a simple walk into a meditative practice. As you walk, pay attention to the sensation of your feet hitting the ground. Notice the rhythm of your steps and the way your body moves. Be aware of the sights, sounds, and smells around you without getting lost in thought.</p>

            <div class="practice-card">
                <h3>3. Mindful Eating</h3>
                <p>Before you eat, take a moment to appreciate your food. Notice its colors, textures, and aromas. As you chew, pay attention to the taste and feel of each bite. By eating slowly and mindfully, you can enjoy your food more and become more attuned to your body's signals of hunger and fullness.</p>

        <h2>Start Small, Be Consistent</h2>
        <p>The goal of mindfulness is not to eliminate thoughts, but to observe them without attachment. Start with just one of these practices for a few minutes each day. Over time, you'll find that the practice of being present becomes a natural part of your life.</p>
