        <h1>How to Start Strength Training: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
        <p>Embarking on a strength training journey can be a rewarding way to transform your body and health. This guide will walk you through the fundamentals, from mastering basic movements to choosing the right equipment, so you can begin safely and effectively.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Before you begin, remember that consistency and proper form are far more important than lifting heavy weights. Start slow, master the movements, and gradually increase the difficulty over time.</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li><strong>Warm-up:</strong> Always begin with 5-10 minutes of light cardio (like jogging in place or jumping jacks) and dynamic stretches to prepare your muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong> Prioritize doing each exercise correctly. If you're unsure, watch a tutorial or use a mirror to check your posture.</li>
            <li><strong>Start with Bodyweight:</strong> You don't need equipment to get strong. Bodyweight exercises are an excellent way to build a solid foundation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Basic Exercises for Beginners</h2>
        <p>Here are some fundamental exercises that target major muscle groups. Aim for **3 sets of 10-15 repetitions** for each exercise, with a short rest in between sets.</p>
        <div class="exercise-list">
            <div class="exercise-card">
                <h3>Squats</h3>
                <p>A key exercise for your legs and glutes. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keep your chest up, and lower your hips as if sitting in a chair.</p>
                <img class="exercise-image" src="https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a%20person%20doing%20a%20bodyweight%20squat%20with%20good%20form?width=300&height=150&seed=1" alt="A person doing a bodyweight squat with good form.">
            </div>
            <div class="exercise-card">
                <h3>Push-ups</h3>
                <p>This exercise builds upper body strength. Beginners can modify by performing them on their knees to make it easier. Keep your back straight and lower your chest toward the floor.</p>
                <img class="exercise-image" src="https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a%20person%20doing%20a%20push-up%20on%20their%20knees%20with%20good%20form?width=300&height=150&seed=2" alt="A person doing a push-up on their knees with good form.">
            </div>
            <div class="exercise-card">
                <h3>Lunges</h3>
                <p>Great for single-leg strength and balance. Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.</p>
                <img class="exercise-image" src="https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a%20person%20performing%20a%20lunge%20with%20a%20straight%20back?width=300&height=150&seed=3" alt="A person performing a lunge with a straight back.">
            </div>
            <div class="exercise-card">
                <h3>Glute Bridges</h3>
                <p>Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips toward the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top.</p>
                <img class="exercise-image" src="https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a%20person%20on%20their%20back%20doing%20a%20glute%20bridge?width=300&height=150&seed=4" alt="A person on their back doing a glute bridge.">
            </div>
            <div class="exercise-card">
                <h3>Plank</h3>
                <p>An essential core-strengthening exercise. Hold a push-up position, either on your hands or forearms, keeping your body in a straight line from head to heels. Hold for 30-60 seconds.</p>
                <img class="exercise-image" src="https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a%20person%20holding%20a%20plank%20with%20good%20form?width=300&height=150&seed=5" alt="A person holding a plank with good form.">
            </div>
            <div class="exercise-card">
                <h3>Dumbbell Rows</h3>
                <p>If you have dumbbells, this is a great exercise for your back. Hinge at your hips, keep your back flat, and pull the weight up toward your chest.</p>
                <img class="exercise-image" src="https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a%20person%20doing%20a%20dumbbell%20row%20with%20one%20knee%20on%20a%20bench?width=300&height=150&seed=6" alt="A person doing a dumbbell row with one knee on a bench.">

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Finding the Right Equipment</h2>
        <p>You can start with just your body, but here are a few inexpensive and versatile pieces of equipment to consider as you progress.</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li><strong>Dumbbells:</strong> A pair of light-to-medium dumbbells (5-15 lbs) is perfect for adding resistance to squats, lunges, and rows.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Bands:</strong> These are great for adding tension to bodyweight exercises and are easy to travel with.</li>
            <li><strong>A Yoga Mat:</strong> Provides a comfortable surface for floor exercises like planks and glute bridges.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overall Benefits of Strength Training</h2>
        <p>Starting a regular strength training routine can lead to remarkable changes both inside and out.</p>
        <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li><strong>Increases Metabolism:</strong> Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Bone Density:</strong> Strength training places stress on your bones, stimulating them to grow stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosts Confidence:</strong> Seeing and feeling your body get stronger can have a powerful positive impact on your self-esteem.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhances Daily Function:</strong> Simple tasks like carrying groceries or lifting a child become easier.</li>
